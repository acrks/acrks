💻 I am a Full Stack developer with a passion for creative problem solving and building new technologies to make people's lives easier!

🔭 Over the last year and a half, I've had the pleasure of learning Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Ruby. In order to bring them to life, I learned front-end languages such as Rails/React/CSS3/HTML, and also AWS, MongoDB, MERN and AJAX to store all the wonderful data. I've had a lot of fun bringing ideas to life and can't wait for what this path will bring!

A little about my projects:

✂️ cutabove is an app created for salons, barbers and freelancers that can easily get appointment bookings and reviews. It is intended to be exclusive for people all around the US to book appointments for haircuts, hairstyles, or whatever they would like to get done.

🏠 Rillow is my full-stack application Zillow-clone. Users can create listings, schedule tours, or search for properties in a certain city or neighborhood.

🖥 TypeTricks is my attempt to make touch typing fun. Using a scoring system based on time, players are given a tight deadline to spell words that appear on the screen. Using old school game-play mechanics, this project is created entirely using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

🐍 A Python based search engine that utilizes 8 data structures. This was part of a project that culminated in a paper analyzing the efficiency/time taken as scale and complexity of the search queries increased

🖱️🎮⚡🏀🏈⚽ A few things about myself: 
🧑‍🍳  I love to cook, 🏊‍♂️  swim, and 📖 read. I'm an avid soccer fan and am currently learning Spanish. Never above creating an app to prove a point/take a joke way too far.
