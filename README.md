Hello there! My name is Alex Crooks, and I am a former political staffer turned software engineer with a passion for making simple solutions to complex problems.

My resume demonstrates my versatility and mastery of several coding languages, both front-end and back-end, as well as relational databases.

My most recent experience was a contract with Prepango, using an incredible amount of data from their hundreds of vending machines in international airports and Greyhound stations across the United States. I worked with years of legacy data to build internal tools for their staff to monitor restocks and machine deployment

As a software engineer at Activate, I was given an exciting new project building white-label platforms tailored specifically to brands including Walmart and Amazon Music, with the frontend in React/Vue, backend in PHP, and a MySQL database management system. I knew none of these languages before my start date with Activate. Working collaboratively with other teams gave me excellent experience pair programming. Combined with maintenance and building out new features on the existing website, this was a unique and thoughtful experience that gave me a fantastic grounding in OOP & system design.

After porting existing features from the React frontend of Activate, we worked with an unexpectedly short deadline from the client to ensure that each facet of the site was no longer hardcoded, but stored within our database. This allowed me to know the platform intimately from the ground up and participate in the entire product lifecycle, from conception to deployment and maintenance, frequently collaborating with product designers and the clients themselves to ensure the project met guidelines and expectations.

At the beginning of the pandemic, I decided to move back to California to retrain as a Fullstack Software Developer. Upon completing almost every Comp Sci class at De Anza College in the heart of Silicon Valley, specializing in Java, Python, and C++, I decided to hone my full-stack skills by attending App Academy, a coding boot camp. 

This intensive training gave me the perfect experience working with frameworks in a professional environment and manner. In that time, I developed three full-stack web apps that I am extremely proud of. These projects include cutAbove, a MERN stack web app connecting customers to local barbershops and stylists, Rillow, a Ruby-on-Rails clone of Zillow, and a JavaScript game to improve touch typing skills.

I am very excited to apply my talents in the field and work to build the best possible product.

🖱️🎮⚡🏀🏈⚽ A few things about myself: 
🧑‍🍳  I love to cook, 🏊‍♂️  swim, and 📖 read. I'm an avid soccer fan and am currently learning Spanish. Never above creating an app to prove a point or take a joke way too far.
